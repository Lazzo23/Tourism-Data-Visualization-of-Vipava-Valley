## About
Tourism analysis requires reasoning about complex spatio-temporal relationships between visitor behavior, infrastructure capacity, and environmental conditions. This paper presents an interactive web based visualization system for exploring tourism and weather data in the Vipava Valley, Slovenia, covering the period from January 2020 to September 2025. The system integrates a choropleth map with coordinated temporal visualizations that depict tourist arrivals, overnight stays, accommodation capacity, average length of stay, and weather measurements. Built using D3.js, the tool supports interactive spatial selection, multi-municipality comparison, attribute toggling, and aggregation. We demonstrate how the proposed design supports exploratory analysis and regional tourism decision making through a qualitative, task-based evaluation.
